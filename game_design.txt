PERUDO GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT
=========================

1. GAME STRUCTURE
----------------
- Single player vs AI opponents (5 - 7 AI players)
- Each player starts with 5 dice
- Points system for betting
- Bank system for loans

2. CORE GAME MECHANICS
---------------------
Game Flow:
├── Setup
│   ├── Player starts with 1000 points
│   ├── Choose number of AI opponents (2-3)
│   └── Each player gets 5 dice
│
├── Round Structure
│   ├── Player's Turn
│   │   ├── View own dice
│   │   ├── Make a bet (quantity + face value)
│   │   └── Pass to next player
│   │
│   ├── AI Turns
│   │   ├── AI makes decision based on:
│   │   │   ├── Their dice
│   │   │   ├── Previous bets
│   │   │   └── Personality type
│   │   └── Can either:
│   │       ├── Raise the bet
│   │       └── Call "dudo" (challenge)
│   │
│   └── Resolution
│       ├── If "dudo" called:
│       │   ├── Reveal all dice
│       │   ├── Count actual dice
│       │   └── Determine winner
│       └── Loser loses one die
│
└── Game End
    ├── When a player loses all dice
    └── Calculate final points

3. BETTING SYSTEM
----------------
Betting Rules:
├── Each bet consists of:
│   ├── Quantity (how many dice)
│   └── Face value (1-6)
│
├── Betting Options:
│   ├── Raise quantity
│   ├── Raise face value
│   └── Call "dudo"
│
└── Special Rules:
    ├── 1s are wild (count as any number)
    ├── Can't bet lower than previous bet
    └── Must either raise or challenge

4. POINTS & BANKING SYSTEM
-------------------------
Economy System:
├── Points
│   ├── Starting: 1000 points
│   ├── Betting amounts: 50-500 points
│   └── Win/loss multipliers
│
├── Bank Features
│   ├── Loan tiers: 500, 1000, 2000
│   ├── 0% interest
│   ├── 5-round repayment
│   └── One loan at a time
│
└── Risk Management
    ├── Can't go below 0 points
    ├── Must have enough points to bet
    └── Loan repayment tracking

5. AI PERSONALITIES
------------------
AI Types:
├── Conservative
│   ├── Takes fewer risks
│   ├── Challenges more often
│   └── Makes safer bets
│
├── Aggressive
│   ├── Takes more risks
│   ├── Makes higher bets
│   └── Challenges less often
│
└── Balanced
    ├── Adapts to situation
    ├── Mix of strategies
    └── Medium risk level

6. UI/UX DESIGN

│
├── Bank Interface
│   ├── Points display
│   ├── Loan management
│   └── Transaction history
│
└── Game Controls
    ├── Betting controls
    ├── Challenge button
    └── Game settings

### 🀄 Additional Party Rules (飞、斋、劈、豹子)
In party-style Perudo games (especially drinking/KTV variants), these additional mechanics may be used:

- **斋 (Zhai)**: If a player calls a bid with “斋” (e.g. “3个5斋”), it means that from that point on, all dice showing `1` 
are no longer wild — they only count as literal 1s. This increases the challenge and reduces bluffing power.

- **飞斋 (Double Fei Zhai)**: To cancel a previous "斋" declaration and restore 1s as wilds, the next player must “飞斋” — this means **doubling the quantity** of the previous斋 bid while keeping the same face value.
  - For example, if the last player bid `3个5斋`, then the next player must bid at least `6个5飞` to解除斋状态.
  - A bid like `4个5` or `5个5` would not be enough — the斋 state would remain in effect.

- **劈 (Pi)**: A drinking mechanic. If someone challenges your bet with a "劈", and you accept, you drink half a cup if you're wrong. If not accepted, the challenger drinks.
  - Players can escalate with 反劈, doubling the drink amount.

- **豹子 (Bao Zi)**: If a player rolls all the same number (e.g., five 6s), it's called a 豹子. It beats all standard bets unless a higher 豹子 appears.
  - Special case: five `1`s (wilds) count as `7个1` — the strongest possible 豹子.
